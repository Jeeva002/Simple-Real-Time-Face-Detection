# Real-Time Face Detection

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier. The application captures video from the webcam and detects faces in real-time, displaying rectangles around detected faces.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade.
- Simple and efficient face tracking.
